Based on edits from the ros_openpose repo. Likely does not work right now; however, ros_openpose_synchronous.py and bite_trigger.py do work when placed into the original ros_openpose package.

Needs work to make an independent package!

Also, the CMakeLists likely does not work right now. Compiling this reduced package has not been tested, and needs edits!
